# Failed Transactions & Fraud Pattern Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes transaction data to identify users with unusually high numbers of failed transactions and multiple payment methods, which may indicate fraudulent behavior.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analysis
- Total failed transactions per user
- Distinct payment methods used
- High-risk user identification

## 📁 Project Structure
- data/: Raw transaction data
- sql/: SQL queries
- notebooks/: Python analysis
- visuals/: Charts and graphs

## 🚀 Insights
- Users with more than 5 failed transactions across multiple payment methods were flagged
- Payment method diversity combined with failures can indicate suspicious activity

## 📌 Next Improvements
- Add time-based fraud detection
- Build Power BI dashboard
